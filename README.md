# FederalPulse
This is an iOS app to browse notices published in the Federal Register

The Federal Register is a daily publication of the U.S. Government. Every day, agencies across the federal government publish Notices of Proposed Rulemaking to give interested parties an opportunity to comment on new federal regulations.
They also publish new final rules after the notice-and-comment period has ended. For example, every time a new species is to be added or removed from the Endangered Species List, several notices and rules are published giving detailed information and justification and providing the opportunity for anybody to submit official comments.

This app enables users to keep track of the "pulse" of the federal government by reading notices and rules. It offers a "backlog", which is a way to save notices and rules for later reading, as well as a favorites section to allow users to keep track of particularly interesting notices or rules.
It's a good way to stay on top of what the government is working on, and to stay informed about changes that might be of interest to the user.
